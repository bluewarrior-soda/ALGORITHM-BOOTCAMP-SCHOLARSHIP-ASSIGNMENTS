Some of these untidy columns will be renamed to better words in the beginning of the Exploratory Data Analysis part.\n\n### Categorical\n**1. near_earth**\n--> Indicates whether an asteroid are near to Earth.\n\n**2. potentially_hazardous** (target)\n--> Indicates whether an asterdoid is hazardous (harmful) to the Earth.\n\n**3. class**\n--> Class or group of asteroid.\n\n### Numerical\n**1. absolute_magnitude_parameter**\n--> Measures the absolute magnitude of an asteroid. Absolute magnitude of an asteroid is the visual magnitude an observer would record.\n\n**2. epoch**\n--> Epoch of osculation in modified Julian day form.\n\n**3. eccentricity**\n-> A measure of the amount by which it deviates from a circle it is found by dividing the distance between the focal points of the ellipse by the length of the major axis.\n\n**4. semi_major_axis**\n--> A half of the longest diameter of an ellipse (in AU units).\n\n**5. perihelion_distance**\n--> A measure of the closest distance of an asteroid with Earth (in AU units).\n\n**6. inclination**\n--> An angle with respect to x-y ecliptic plane.\n\n**7. om**\n--> Stands for optical monitor. \n\n**8. w**\n--> No specific information\n\n**9. ma**\n--> No specific information\n\n**10. ad**\n--> No specific information\n\n**11. n**\n--> Stands for nadir. The nadir is the point directly below an observer.\n\n**12. tp**\n--> Time of perihelion passsage of asteroids.\n\n**13. per**\n--> No specific information\n\n**14. per_y**\n--> No specific information\n\n**15. moid_ld**\n--> Earth Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance au Unit.\n\n**16. sigma_i**\n--> Velocity dispersion of asteroid.\n\n**17. sigma_w**\n--> Velocity dispersion of asteroid.\n\n**18. rms**\n--> The RMS (Radio Millimeter Submillimeter) value is the effective value of a varying voltage or current of asteroids.","metadata":{}}]}

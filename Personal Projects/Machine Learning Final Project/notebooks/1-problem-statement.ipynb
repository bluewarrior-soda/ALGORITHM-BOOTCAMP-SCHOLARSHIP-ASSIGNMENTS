Astronauts nowadays are keen to determine whether an asteroid can be hazardous. But in order to accomplish that, a long process and more scientist are required.\n\n# Business Objective\nThe objective of this project is to predict whether an asteroid is potentially harmful to Earth. The main business benefit is to save astronauts large amount of time and energy to make predictions. \n\n# Output\nThe output of this project is either an asteroid is hazardous or not.\n\n# Machine Learning Task\nThis project uses supervised learning as the type of learning because the target variable is already labeled and known. The type of supervised learning will be classification since the type of dependent variable is categorical.\n\n# Performance Measure\nWe use several metrics to evaluate our model performance and accuracy, as follows.\n* Accuracy\n* Precision\n* Recall\n* F1-Score\n\n# Acknowledgements\nThis project uses Asteroid Dataset, which is organized by NASA and JPL. The dataset consists of 958,524 asteroid observations and 45 columns. The dataset can be found in the link below.\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/sakhawat18/asteroid-dataset","metadata":{}}]}
